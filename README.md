# Interpreter-zig

Continuation from the [interpreter-rust](https://github.com/tushyagupta81/interpreter-rust)\
The rust borrow checker made the way of making the interpreter feel like hell
> I will still be following [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) hopeful on my own this time

## Current progress

## Shifted to zig

Before doing the interpreter in rust I was hesitant to chose which one and in the end choose rust\
I enjoy rust but i after doing some complex things in it I felt like I was being held back\
Most probabaly this is a skill issue and my way of thinking in OOP's mentality
